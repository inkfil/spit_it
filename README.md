# spit_it
Spit_it is a hash utility used to hash passwords using Scrypt-pkdf2 hashing algorithm.

spit_it takes a string password and spits out a hash for that password.

Originally this utility was inspired from [node-scrypt](https://github.com/barrysteyn/node-scrypt) repository to perform password hashing in node, using Colin Percival's scrypt algorithm.


#Usage

```./spit_it <password_to_hash> ```
